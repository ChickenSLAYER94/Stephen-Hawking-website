                        <p>In 2017, the professor told Wired magazine that the AI “genie is out of the bottle”. He was fearful that developments in artificial intelligence will give rise to “a new form of life that will outperform humans”.<br>
                        <blockquote>"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history," the scientists wrote.</blockquote> "Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks." The group warned of a time when this technology would be "outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand."<br> 
                        Hawking reiterated this stance while speaking at a technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, in November 2017. Noting how AI could potentially make gains in wiping out poverty and disease, but could also lead to such theoretically destructive actions as the development of autonomous weapons, he said, "We cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it."</p>

                        <p>To ensure humanity’s survival, the theoretical physicist thought we would have to colonise other planets and solar systems. “Spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave Earth,” he told an audience at a Norwegian science and arts festival in 2017.<br>
                        <blockquote>"I believe that the long-term future of the human race must be in space,"</blockquote> Hawking said in a& 2010 interview with BigThink. "It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on planet Earth in the next hundred years, let alone the next thousand, or million. The human race shouldn't have all its eggs in one basket, or on one planet. Let's hope we can avoid dropping the basket until we have spread the load." </p>

                        <p>Hawking also had concerns about climate change, which were amplified by the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016. “Trump’s action [pulling out of the Paris agreement] could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250C and raining sulphuric acid,” Hawking told BBC News. His warning comes on the heels of last week’s alarming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report warning that we only have 12 years to make changes massive enough to keep global warming to moderate levels. Without such changes, extended droughts, more frequent tropical storms, and rising sea levels will only be the beginning.

                        <blockquote> climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, he says, and we are acting with “reckless indifference to our future on planet Earth.”</blockquote>
                            
                        In fact, we might not have a future at all, he says, warning us not to put all our eggs “in one basket.” And yes, that basket is planet Earth. Even if humans figure out a way escape, “the millions of species that inhabit the Earth” will be doomed, he says. “And that will be on our conscience as a race.”</p>

                        <p>He also thought that should we make contact with extraterrestrials the outcome might not be positive. In 2010, he told the Discovery Channel: “If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans.”<br>
                        In July 2015, Hawking held a news conference in London to announce the launch of a project called Breakthrough Listen. Funded by Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, Breakthrough Listen was created to devote more resources to the discovery of extraterrestrial life. 
                        Hawking’s views aren’t shared in full by his scientific peers, many of whom emphasize the sheer difficulty of interstellar space travel—and the fact that human radio transmissions have long leaked from Earth, sending a beacon to anyone out there. (How would we react to alien visitors? A recent study says we might be surprisingly sanguine.)<br>
                        “Any society with the capability to threaten Earth is overwhelmingly likely to already have the kit required to pick up the leakage we’ve been wafting skyward for seven decades,” Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute, wrote in a 2016 opinion piece for the Guardian. “And since we’ve been busy for a lifetime filling the seas of space with bottled messages marking our existence and position, it’s a bit silly to fret about new bottles.”<br>
                        Hawking also has marveled at the idea of extraterrestrial life, once saying that such a find would be “the single greatest discovery in history.” In a similar vein, Hawking threw his support behind the Breakthrough Starshot project, a $100-million initiative aiming to send tiny spacecraft to the Alpha Centauri star system, 25 trillion miles away.</p>
